## Welcome to the Governance Servies Guild GitHub Organisation

> Cardano Governance Services Guild is a network of individuals with a broad range of experience in Blockchain governance, administration, and project management. We support the exploration, development, and implementation of decentralised solutions to help teams govern their own initiatives. We do not prescribe or require particular ways of working but aim to identify appropriate mechanisms and/or tools that suit each teamâ€™s individual needs.

## Funded by Project Catalyst
